# GBM-STOCK-MC

The repository consisted of historical stock price files of Tesla Mortors and Danaos Corp, and the GBM Simulation programs
that will generate simulations.

The R code is for reading simulation data and plotting the simulated stock paths.

The program can reading any stock prices data files by changing the simulation matrix size of the 
number of days in the data and number of simulations wanted. 

To run the program on command line, please place all data files and program codes into one file. 

The project's research paper is included for anyone who is interested on our findings and conclusions.
